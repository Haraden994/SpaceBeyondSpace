## High Concept
Landed in a small green planet, Clara and Ashildr discover a scientific colony studying the local vegetation. An ancient mystery lies beneath the ground. Adventure yourself in the depths of the research facilities to unveil what threatens the people inside. With Clara’s brilliance and Ashildr’s experience the path seems simple, but people aren’t the only ones to be rescued.

## Backstory

### Scientists' backstory
A group of scientists found a planet with an Earth-like atmosphere and decided to settle a camp on it. They also built two laboratories, not too far from the camp, to conduct their studies on the plants.
The scientists were studying the planet to understand if it could be a possible human colony.
After conducting some research on the planet, the scientists discovered something interesting within the plants: they seemed to have the same DNA.

### Planet's backstory
A long time ago a sentient plant seed started to attract solid matter to itself. The seed grew up, attracting more and more solid matter and transforming itself into a planetoid.
After some time, the seed reached a form which allowed it to live as the planetoid core, letting itself grow as plants all over the surface.

## Setting
The story is set in a planet whose core is a sentient seed. The planet surface is mostly composed by vegetation and the atmosphere is similar to the Earth’s one.
On the planet’s surface, the scientists initially built a main campsite and a landing zone to reach the planet with spaceships. Then they built two laboratories (one opposite to the other) and an additional campsite near them. The two laboratories are not too far one another and they both have the same distance (longer than the one from the two laboratories) from the main campsite and the second campsite. Both the laboratories are built on more levels, including underground levels.
In the planet's undergrounds are randomly located some caves with plenty of vegetation, enlightened by shiny crystals on the upper side. One of these caves has been reached by a tunnel dug from the second laboratory, and from there another tunnel has been dug until the planet's core.

## Synopsis
While traveling in spacetime and talking in broad terms about their latest adventure, Clara and Ashildr activate the TARDIS control panel and move towards their next destination. As soon as they get ready and get out the TARDIS, the two girls realize they were in a human colony on an undefined planet. The diner-shaped TARDIS was out of style in spite of the surroundings, though being hidden from the main ways nobody would ever notice it.
The two girls take a look around, and explore the surroundings. Judging by the sight and sounds, they were in a sort of landing area for small spaceships. The dead end of their way forces the duo to get inside a building, and as soon as they get outside from the other side they must stop at a guard post for identification. Clara and Ashildr show their psychic badges making up an excuse on the fly and telling them they are fresh crew, and are told that was not the area they were supposed to be since all scientific and technic personnel must stay in the campsite when not working.
Clara and Ashildr wonder what was the reason behind human presence on the planet; after brief investigation, they discover the small colony was intended for scientific purposes and eventually colonization, and manage to make up a better cover from that moment on. Next, they needed to find a way to reach the main campsite, discovering there was an automatic railway at the other end of the spaceport. There were displays showing concepts of what seemed a rich and peaceful human city, a form of motivational advertising. Clara and Ashildr get to the railway, and leave for the campsite.
The campsite is made up of small modular buildings in which the lives of colonies goes on. Clara and Ashildr learn colonists are mostly scientists and technicians, the rest is maintenance personnel in charge of keeping the colony up and running. They also get to learn there is a main scientific research project which focuses on studying local plants, the only form of life discovered on the planet. Since the girls' cover is being new personnel, they are redirected to the training facility in which they will be instructed about their tasks in the research labs.
When they get there, the two of them learn about the main discovery of the scientific project: all plant life, despite being varying and different, has always something in common with the rest; it is to believe there is a common root to all plants on the planet, and they are close to a breakthrough.
When asking for more info, Clara notices there's something worrying in the answer she's told from their trainer; the plant system has developed like a huge network, like a neural system and maybe even a form of intelligence; however there are rumors talking about voices and a danger, though few people really listen to these.
Clara and Ashildr crave to know more about what starts to seem more like a mistery. They reach for the centralized archive in the research facility, where everything is stored, by finding a way to access such a reserved area. Reading result papers about studies and experiments, they learn about the unified plant network, possibly originated from a single big seed down below the planet surfaces, which possesses unique properties such as symbiotic adaptation with other plants and remarkable ability to adapt to nearly any environment condition.
An emergency lockdown of all systems occurs shortly after the earth rumbles and a light tremble shakes the room, like an earthquake. A loud voice coming from the speakers tells the personnel to reach for the closest gathering area, and the two girls join the others outside of the building.
After the emergency evacuation it was announced an incident in the underground laboratories, Clara and Ashildr volunteer to go with the rescue team claiming they can somehow help to move in the facility.
Clara and Ashildr get to the laboratories, and split from the rescue team in order to increase the chances to find the missing group of people. They face the security systems of the laboratories, and find a way to communicate to the other squad via a terminal. Once they are told the squad position, it's easy to find the way to them. Meanwhile, strange sounds are heard in the background, like something crawling underneath and around the corridors.
Clara and Ashildr find the missing group of researchers, and they act nervous looking forward to get out as soon as possible. On the way back, Ashildr notices there has been a while since they heard from the other rescue team, and that was strange. Eventually they will be found dead or unconscious.
Talking to some of the survivors, they pushed to get out quickly, allegedly blaming something gone wrong.
While reaching for the exit, some plant-like minions appear from the ceiling. The group is confused by their presence, until one of them approaches one of the survivors and attacks. Clara and Ashildr must fight back these creatures, while keeping safe the others. Other encounters take place while reaching for the exit.
Clara and Ashildr want to know the truth, and ask questions. The scientists expose their theory about the main seed shifting from a dormant state to active, and trying to defend itself from the humans. However the crew is reluctant to answer this kind of questions, except one which tells Clara they better talk somewhere else, far away from other people. Ashildr is not convinced by him/her, but Clara wants to take the shot. Either talking to the scientist or finding another way to gather more intel, Clara and Ashildr learn that more about the project and its real dangers can be found by talking to the project chief in person, who is missing too though in the other research facility. The duo decides to rescue him on their own.
Next objective is to sneak in the second research facility and look for the scientist. He has been missing since the emergency, and nobody seems to know where he is. Clara wants to get to him or his work to make everything clear. The two of them are led by another scientist, who claims to be the professor's assistant, and is truly worried about what is going on in the colony. As well as before, Clara and Ashildr must face the base defense systems before getting to the research labs; everything looks more secured than before, and some areas look untidy as well. They are not able to find the professor, but notice a well-secured area beyond which a passage to a sort of cavern is located. They find a way through and notice some papers and documents, but no relevant information is found. Then they walk to the end of the cavern to find themselves in a great subterrain cave, at the center of which a giant bulb lies.
The stunning view of a giant plant seed from which many roots were coming out from, was accompained by the assistant explaining that was the very core of all the vegetation on the planet, and they were studying it due to its unique properties from a scientific point of view. The plant tries to obstacle the trio when they attempt to get closer, but then holds back and let them move to a certain distance from itself.
They establish a communication, the plant is sentient and talks to Clara and Ashildr; both asks why it is attacking the humans, but the answer is enigmatic: humans attacked first. After some talking, the two girls guessed the plant was just defending itself, but more details emerge when the plant tells them about the other scientist who is "creating monsters" and keeps all the proof in its hidden laboratory.
Clara and Ashildr get back and manage to enter the secured laboratory they saw before; when inside, they find several documents on a research aimed to define the plant's rigenerative properties and a possible application for human beings. Further areas store diagrams showing a prototypal auto-rigenerative human arm, some vials with floating substances, and an archive of documents with the results of the research. Clara and Ashildr realize he was trying to make humans heal as fast as the plant by applying mutations to people, and this thought is confermed by what they find in the last rooms: tubes holding strange hybrid creatures, half-human and half-plant.
They find the professor here, who played lost and waiting for rescue; but then he understands pretending is not necessary anymore, and reveals its plan to Clara and Ashildr who were asking many questions. Then he runs away with some documents and vials, locks the door behind himself and frees the monsters inside the tubes.
Clara and Ashildr must fight for their lives. Once every enemy is defeated, they must find a way out of there and chase the professor before he gets away with his illicit experiments on the plant and on other personnel members.
The two girls manage to get through the traps and obstacles activated by the professor fleeing. They find him and face him in a lasting fight; he uses its vials to summon his creatures, and finally augments himself in a desperate attempt to defeat Clara and Ashildr.
The two girls win the fight, and take the professor with them out of the facility, telling the others what really happened and his real intentions. He's brought away from the planet and everything is fixed to continue the life in the colony in peace once again.

## Level Story
Once outside the first laboratory, Clara and Ashildr meet some of the scientists they saved in the underground facilities. They are told something happened in the underground facilities of the second laboratory and they decide to go looking for some intel about what happened. Three scientists offer to accompany the girls inside the second laboratory, but suddenly the door opened and a couple of scientists run out of the lab screaming out of fear, making them change their minds. The scientists refused to go inside the lab, they wouldn't risk their lives again. Clara and Ashildr adventure by themselves inside the lab, which apparently seems desolate, to look for some info. 
First rooms are empty, but then they find inside a room a scientist immobilized by a plant, which was going to kill him. Ashildr hit the plant, trying to save him, but it seems to be indestructible. The scientist explains them they have to inject a serum into the plant first, to stop its regeneration process, and then they could kill it. Clara asks the scientist where to find the serum he just mentioned and the scientist replies they have to prepare it and inject it into the plant. He continues, telling them all they need is a big syringe, a herbicide and some sodium chloride. They have to find a herbicide and mix it with some sodium chloride to make it stronger and then to fill the big syringe with the chemical mix they made, the serum. Clara and Ashildr find the ingredients exploring the lab's rooms and prepare the serum. They inject the serum to the plant and then kill it, saving the scientist, who immediately thanks them. He presents himself as Max and explains them the plants had come to life and were rebelling against humans, trying to kill them. He continues saying that in the underground levels the scientists were conducting studies on the plants and assures them he told them everything he knew about what happened.
Clara tells there must be still people in trouble in the underground levels and that they had to find a way to save them. The scientist tells her she is crazy and that he wouldn’t have gone in the underground levels, first of all because all the people on those levels were probably dead by now, and then because he wouldn’t have risked his life for them. The scientist suggests everyone to escape.
Ashildr says she wouldn’t have escaped like a coward, irritating the scientist, who answers her he is not a coward, he is just a normal person, not a crazy one like her. After that, he tries to exit the door but plant creatures appear outside, trying to kill him.
Ashildr saves him from the plants and closes the door, barricading it with the nearest cabinet.
The scientist agrees to join their “team” and to go to the underground levels, but now they were stuck in that room, with plant creatures outside it.
After a moment of hesitation, Clara starts talking and explains her plan: they could use the ventilation ducts and find a way to the elevator. Everyone agree to Clara's plan and they start going in the ventilation ducts until they arrive in a empty room, which the scientist recognizes. The scientist knows where the elevator is and tells them it’s not too far from their position. He offers to guide them and starts moving.
Once they reach the elevator, they call it, but when it arrives, the door does not open and they find out it’s blocked. Someone tries to fix it up, but in the meanwhile a group of plant creatures arrives and threatens them. Clara and Ashildr have to find a way to give the one fixing the door some time to fix it. They have to slow the plant creatures down.
They fight to take time to fix the elevator’s door, then they finally got into the elevator and moved to the underground level, it is covered by roots, with a dark atmosphere: almost all the lights are broken and the roots create obstacles trying to prevent them to pass through the facilities and to seek the survivors.
They had to save as many scientists as possible and to find out the truth behind these creatures. After surviving an ambush from many plant creatures they reach a great gate leading to an underground cave strangely full of vegetation with the upper side covered by some shiny crystals, their attention was taken by a blinding light flowing outside a hole in the ground. They find out a rough tunnel leading to another cave, unnaturally shiny, where they find out a giant seed emanating a strange warm light.
The scientist stated, by checking on his tablet, that they were in the center of the planet. A loud noise of roots moving is heard and a shape resembling some kind of face form from a near stone. The face ask them: “Again here… What are you willing to do to me this time?! GO AWAY!”. After an useless battle against the plants, the party is captured by roots and vines, begging for their lives, the scientist say this had to be caused by that mad professor.
They felt the plants hesitate. The plant face say that a man like him did all this, uncovering the final truth. The real enemy is that professor, the seed was the main test subject!
