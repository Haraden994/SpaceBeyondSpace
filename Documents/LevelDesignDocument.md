# 1. Introduction

*Space Beyond Space - A Doctor Who Story* is a video game proposal, non-canon adventure taking place in the *Doctor Who* science fiction series universe. It focuses on the early adventures of Clara Oswald right after the ninth season finale of the BBC television series of the same name.

This project is developed as a stand-alone video game, whereas it has the potential to become the first installment of a video game series, depending on critics reception and the Publisher's Marketing Division future decisions.

## 1.1. Overview

*Space Beyond Space* is a single player, third person role-playing action video game featuring a linear storyline and a slow-paced gameplay. There are fights against enemies, puzzle to be solved, and side quests which are non-essential to completing the game but contribute to the setting and story plot. The game core mechanics are an adaptation of *Dungeons & Dragons 3.5* edition rules.

## 1.2. Game information @

**Game title:** *Space Beyond Space - A Doctor Who Story* (temporary)

**Game genre:** Role-playing game

**Game mode:** single player

**Total levels:** 8

**Developed levels:** 1

**Developed level sub-sections:** Y

**Level name:** *Disclosure* (temporary)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# 2. Game story

The game story takes place right after the events occurring in the *Doctor Who* ninth season finale; it develops as a spin-off featuring Clara and Me as the main characters.

## 2.1. High concept

The main idea behind the game is as follows:

> Clara and Me's journey leads them to a human settlement on an ancient planet-shaped sentient plant, whom an evil scientist tries to exploit in order to get superhuman augmentations.

It results in an extended, more appealing high concept for the game:

> Landed on a small, green planet, Clara and me discover a human scientific settlement studying the local vegetation. An ancient mystery lies beneath the ground. Adventure yourself in the depths of the research facilities to unveil what threatens people inside. With Clara's brilliance and Me's experience the path seems simple, but people aren’t the only ones to be rescued.

## 2.2. Setting

The game takes place in the 24th century C.E. on a planet whose core is a sentient plant life form. The planet surface mostly consists of vegetation and the atmosphere is likely to Earth’s.

Scientists live in a small colony made up of a spaceport, the main settlement area, and two facilities; such buildings are separate from each other and house research laboratories on multiple underground floors.

Subterranean quarries and caves can be found in the planet strata. One is linked to the plant core and reachable via the second laboratory when playing.

## 2.3. Characters

### 2.3.1. Main characters

The following are the main relevant characters the player will meet and interact with throughout the whole game, including both goodies and baddies.

	- *Dual element gun*:
It's a broken part of a robotic arm made by the scientific team which Me made usable and gave to Clara. This robot was remotely controlled by scientists to test the temperature resistance of particular plant species using localized streams of fire or ice thanks to its thin long-limbed shape. Clara uses it as a rapier that can also shoot fire or ice with a moderate waiting time between switching to an element or another. (High intelligence and dexterity is needed for this weapon).

	- *No need to breathe*:
After being temporarily saved from her death by the Doctor, Clara became functionally immortal. Clara's heart is in a frozen state and stopped pumping blood inside her body and to her brain. Thus, Clara has no need to breathe. She is in a stasis state.

- **Short Biography**:
Clara has been a nanny and a school teacher, even though during her time she has been traveling in time and space as companion of the Eleventh Doctor, and then of the Twelfth one. She is called "The Impossible Girl" by the Doctor, because he met her and saw her dying in different timelines. Sadly for the Doctor, Clara's death became a fixed point in time, when she died trying to save her friend Rigsy, taking the Quantum Shade Me had pointed on him. The Doctor succeeded in extracting her before her death, but she entered a stasis state, becoming functionally immortal.
After the Doctor unsuccessfully tried to save her from her death, wiping his memory of her, she decided to face her death, travelling "the long way round" back to Gallifrey using her stolen TARDIS, with Me for company.

	- *Health regeneration*:
Me has been saved by the Doctor, who used the Mire technology on her, transforming her into an immortal being. Thanks to this technology, she has continous health regeneration. When she reaches 1 HP, she enters an inactivity phase, where she will regenerate to full health.

- **Short Biography**:
Me is a Viking girl encountered by the Twelfth Doctor and Clara Oswald. After a battle against the Mire, she died, but the Doctor resurrected her using a Mire repair kit, transforming her into an immortal being. During her time, she asked several times to the Doctor to bring her with him as a companion during his travels in time and space, but the Doctor refused each time. For this reason, she became bitter to the Doctor and was convinced from the Time Lords to trick the Doctor into being transported inside his confession dial. Things went differently from what she has planned and Clara died. She didn't mean to kill Clara and apologized to the Doctor, who warned her it would be a good idea for her to stay out of his way.
Me survived until the end of the Universe, assisting to its death into a bubble of reality from Gallifrey, becoming the last living being on the Universe and waiting for the Doctor and Clara.

### 2.3.2. Enemies @

These are the enemies the player must face during the game.

[ Plants list ]

## 2.4. Background

Once she was certain the Twelfth Doctor couldn't remember her, Clara got into the TARDIS and joined Me, then the TARDIS dematerialised leaving behind the Doctor and his own TARDIS.

Clara knows she must return to Gallifrey since her death was a fixed point in time, but she decides to take "the long way 'round" so that the two girls could "stop off along the way" and spend time adventuring together.

### 2.4.1. Human settlement backstory @

> A group of scientists found a planet with an Earth-like atmosphere and decided to settle a camp on it. They also built two laboratories, not too far from the camp, to conduct their studies on the plants. The scientists were studying the planet to understand if it could be a possible human colony. After conducting some research on the planet, the scientists discovered something interesting within the plants: they seemed to have the same DNA.

### 2.4.2. Exoplanet backstory @

> A long time ago a sentient plant seed started to attract solid matter to itself. The seed grew up, attracting more and more solid matter and transforming itself into a planetoid. After some time, the seed reached a form which allowed it to live as the planetoid core, letting itself grow as plants all over the surface.

## 2.5. Synopsis @ 

### 2.5.1. First act

> **Level 1**
> While traveling in spacetime and talking in broad terms about their latest adventure, Clara and Ashildr activate the TARDIS control panel and move towards their next destination.
>
> As soon as they get ready and get out the TARDIS, the two girls realize they were in a human colony on an undefined planet. The diner-shaped TARDIS was ***out of style in spite of the surroundings*** (suggestion: *anachronistic*), though being hidden from the main ways nobody would ever notice it.

> **Level 2**
> The two girls take a look around, and explore the surroundings. From the looks of the sight and sounds, they were in a sort of landing area for small spaceships. The dead end on their way forces the duo to get inside a building, and as soon as they get outside from the other side they must stop at a guard post for identification. Clara and Ashildr show their psychic badges making up an excuse on the fly and telling them they are fresh crew, and are told that was not the area they were supposed to be since all scientific and technic personnel must stay in the campsite when not working.
>
> Clara and Ashildr wonder what was the reason behind human presence on the planet; after brief investigation, and talking to some NPCs around, they discover the small colony was intended for scientific purposes and eventually colonization, and manage to make up a better cover from that moment on. Next, they needed to find a way to reach the main campsite, discovering there was an automatic railway at the other end of the spaceport. There were displays showing concepts of what seemed a rich and peaceful human city, a form of motivational advertising. Clara and Ashildr get to the railway, and leave for the campsite. **[plot point #1/threshold]**
>
> **Level 3**
> The campsite is made up of small modular buildings in which the lives of colonies goes on. By talking to people around (?), Clara and Ashildr learn colonists are mostly scientists and technicians, the rest is maintenance personnel in charge of keeping the colony up and running. They also get to learn there is a main scientific research project which focuses on studying local plants, the only form of life discovered on the planet. Since the girls' cover is being new personnel, they are redirected to the training facility in which they will be instructed about their tasks in the research labs.
> When they get there, the two of them learn about the main discovery of the scientific project: all plant life, despite being varying and different, has always something in common with the rest; it is to believe there is a common root to all plants on the planet, and they are close to a breakthrough.

### 2.5.2. Second act (1/2)

> When asking for more info, Clara notices there's something worrying in the answer she's told from their trainer; the plant system has developed like a huge network, like a neural system and maybe even a form of intelligence; however there are rumors talking about voices and a danger, though few people really listen to these.
>
> **Level 4**
> Clara and Ashildr crave to know more about what starts to seem more like a mistery. They reach for the centralized archive in the research facility, where everything is stored, by finding a way to access such a reserved area. Reading result papers about studies and experiments, they learn about the unified plant network, possibly originated from a single big seed down below the planet surfaces, which possesses unique properties such as symbiotic adaptation with other plants and remarkable ability to adapt to nearly any environment condition.
> **[Rising action, 1]** An emergency lockdown of all systems occurs shortly after the earth rumbles and a light tremble shakes the room, like an earthquake. A loud voice coming from the speakers tells the personnel to reach for the closest gathering area, and the two girls join the others outside of the building.
>
> **Level 5**
> After the emergency evacuation it was announced an incident in the underground laboratories, Clara and Ashildr volunteer to go with the rescue team claiming they can somehow help to move in the facility.
> Clara and Ashildr get to the laboratories, and split from the rescue team in order to increase the chances to find the missing group of people. They face the security systems of the laboratories, and find a way to communicate to the other squad via a terminal. Once they are told the squad position, it's easy to find the way to them. Meanwhile, strange sounds are heard in the background, like something crawling underneath and around the corridors. Clara and Ashildr find the missing group of researchers, and they act nervous looking forward to get out as soon as possible. On the way back, Ashildr notices there has been a while since they heard from the other rescue team, and that was strange. Eventually they will be found dead or unconscious. Talking to some of the survivors, they pushed to get out quickly, allegedly blaming something gone wrong.
> **[crisis]** While reaching for the exit, some plant-like minions appear from the ceiling. The group is confused by their presence, until one of them approaches one of the survivors and attacks. Clara and Ashildr must fight back these creatures, while keeping safe the others. Other encounters take place while reaching for the exit. Clara and Ashildr want to know the truth, and ask questions. The scientists expose their theory about the main seed shifting from a dormant state to active, and trying to defend itself from the humans. However the crew is reluctant to answer this kind of questions, except one which tells Clara they better talk somewhere else, far away from other people. Ashildr is not convinced by him/her, but Clara wants to take the shot. Either talking to the scientist or finding another way to gather more intel, Clara and Ashildr learn that more about the project and its real dangers can be found by talking to the project chief in person, who is missing too though in the other research facility. The duo decides to rescue him on their own.

### 2.5.3. Second act (2/2)

> **Level 6**
> **[rising action, 2/LEVEL START]** Next objective is to sneak in the second research facility and look for the scientist. He has been missing since the emergency, and nobody seems to know where he is. Clara wants to get to him or his work to make everything clear. The two of them are led by another scientist, who claims to be the professor's assistant, and is truly worried about what is going on in the colony. As well as before, Clara and Ashildr must face the base defense systems before getting to the research labs; everything looks more secured than before, and some areas look untidy as well. They are not able to find the professor, but notice a well-secured area beyond which a passage to a sort of cavern is located. They find a way through and notice some papers and documents, but no relevant information is found. Then they walk to the end of the cavern to find themselves in a great subterrain cave, at the center of which a giant bulb lies.
> The stunning view of a giant plant seed from which many roots were coming out from, was accompained by the assistant explaining that was the very core of all the vegetation on the planet, and they were studying it due to its unique properties from a scientific point of view. The plant tries to obstacle the trio when they attempt to get closer, but then holds back and let them move to a certain distance from itself.
> They establish a communication, the plant is sentient and talks to Clara and Ashildr; both asks why it is attacking the humans, but the answer is enigmatic: humans attacked first. After some talking, the two girls guessed the plant was just defending itself, but more details emerge when the plant tells them about the other scientist who is "creating monsters" and keeps all the proof in its hidden laboratory. **[revelation/LEVEL END]**

### 2.5.4. Third act

> **Level 7**
> Clara and Ashildr get back and manage to enter the secured laboratory they saw before; when inside, they find several documents on a research aimed to define the plant's rigenerative properties and a possible application for human beings. Further areas store diagrams showing a prototypal auto-rigenerative human arm, some vials with floating substances, and an archive of documents with the results of the research. Clara and Ashildr realize he was trying to make humans heal as fast as the plant by applying mutations to people, and this thought is confermed by what they find in the last rooms: tubes holding strange hybrid creatures, half-human and half-plant.
> **[climax]** They find the professor here, who played lost and waiting for rescue; but then he understands pretending is not necessary anymore, and reveals its plan to Clara and Ashildr who were asking many questions. Then he runs away with some documents and vials, locks the door behind himself and frees the monsters inside the tubes.
> Clara and Ashildr must fight for their lives. Once every enemy is defeated, they must find a way out of there and chase the professor before he gets away with his illicit experiments on the plant and on other personnel members.
>
> **Level 8**
> The two girls manage to get through the traps and obstacles activated by the professor fleeing. They find him and face him in a lasting fight; he uses its vials to summon his creatures, and ***finally augments himself*** in a desperate attempt to defeat Clara and Ashildr.
> The two girls win the fight, and take the professor with them out of the facility, telling the others what really happened and his real intentions. He's brought away from the planet and ***everything is fixed*** to continue the life in the colony in peace once again.
