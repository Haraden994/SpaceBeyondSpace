# 1. Introduction

*Space Beyond Space - A Doctor Who Story* is a video game proposal, non-canon adventure taking place in the *Doctor Who* science fiction series universe. It focuses on the early adventures of Clara Oswald right after the ninth season finale of the BBC television series of the same name.

This project is developed as a stand-alone video game, whereas it has the potential to become the first installment of a video game series, depending on critics reception and the Publisher's Marketing Division future decisions.

## 1.1. Overview

*Space Beyond Space* is a single player, third person role-playing action video game featuring a linear storyline and a slow-paced gameplay. There are fights against enemies, puzzle to be solved, and side quests which are non-essential to completing the game but contribute to the setting and story plot. The game core mechanics are an adaptation of *Dungeons & Dragons 3.5* edition rules.

## 1.2. Game information

**Game title:** *Space Beyond Space - A Doctor Who Story*

**Game genre:** Role-playing game

**Game mode:** single player

**Total levels:** 8

**Developed levels:** 1

**Developed level sub-sections:** 4

**Level name:** *Disclosure*

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# 2. Game story

The game story takes place right after the events occurring in the *Doctor Who* ninth season finale; it develops as a spin-off featuring Clara and Me as the main characters.

## 2.1. High concept

The main idea behind the game is as follows:

> Clara and Me's journey leads them to a human settlement on an ancient planet-shaped sentient plant, whom an evil scientist tries to exploit in order to get superhuman augmentations.

It results in an extended, more appealing high concept for the game:

> Landed on a small, green planet, Clara and me discover a human scientific settlement studying the local vegetation. An ancient mystery lies beneath the ground. Adventure yourself in the depths of the research facilities to unveil what threatens people inside. With Clara's brilliance and Me's experience the path seems simple, but people aren’t the only ones to be rescued.

## 2.2. Setting

The game takes place in the 24th century C.E. on a planet whose core is a sentient plant life form. The planet surface mostly consists of vegetation and the atmosphere is likely to Earth’s.

Scientists live in a small colony made up of a spaceport, the main settlement area, and two facilities; such buildings are separate from each other and house research laboratories on multiple underground floors.

Subterranean quarries and caves can be found in the planet strata. One is linked to the plant core and reachable via the second laboratory when playing.

## 2.3. Characters

### 2.3.1. Main characters

The following are the main relevant characters the player will meet and interact with throughout the whole game, including both goodies and baddies.

#### 2.3.1.1. Clara Oswald (The Impossible Girl)

![alt_text](img/LDD_Clara.jpg)

**Age**: 27.

**Gender**: Female.

**Values/Virtues**: Brave, Loyal, Clever.

**Personality**: Kind, Feisty, Bossy, Stubborn, Altruist.

**Archetype**: Science Hero, Rebellious Spirit.

**Role**: Protagonist.


**Weapons**:
- *Dual element gun*:
It's a broken part of a robotic arm made by the scientific team which Me made usable and gave to Clara. This robot was remotely controlled by scientists to test the temperature resistance of particular plant species using localized streams of fire or ice thanks to its thin long-limbed shape. Clara uses it as a rapier that can also shoot fire or ice with a moderate waiting time between switching to an element or another. (High intelligence and dexterity is needed for this weapon).

**Abilities**:
- *Taekwondo*:
Clara has been learning the martial art after teaching in the school. She has also helped some of her students in learning it.
- *Fencing skills*:
Clara, during her time with the Doctor, learned self-defence skills and managed to use cold weapons, like swords, to show her fencing skills.
- *Highlight useful items*:
Thanks to her high intelligence stats, Clara can highlight useful items in a certain range around her.
- *No need to breathe*:
After being temporarily saved from her death by the Doctor, Clara became functionally immortal. Clara's heart is in a frozen state and stopped pumping blood inside her body and to her brain. Thus, Clara has no need to breathe. She is in a stasis state.

**Short Biography**:

Clara has been a nanny and a school teacher, even though during her time she has been traveling in time and space as companion of the Eleventh Doctor, and then of the Twelfth one. She is called "The Impossible Girl" by the Doctor, because he met her and saw her dying in different timelines. Sadly for the Doctor, Clara's death became a fixed point in time, when she died trying to save her friend Rigsy, taking the Quantum Shade Me had pointed on him. The Doctor succeeded in extracting her before her death, but she entered a stasis state, becoming functionally immortal.
After the Doctor unsuccessfully tried to save her from her death, wiping his memory of her, she decided to face her death, travelling "the long way round" back to Gallifrey using her stolen TARDIS, with Me for company.

#### 2.3.1.2. Me (Ashildr)

![alt_text](img/LDD_Me.jpg)

**Age**: Universe age.

**Gender**: Female.

**Values/Virtues**: Brave, Agile, Avenger.

**Personality**: Cold, Detached, Vengeful, Bored.

**Archetype**: Action Hero, Rebellious Spirit, Lovable Rogue.

**Role**: Protagonist, Badass.


**Weapons**:
- Any weapon:
During her life, Me managed to use any kind of weapon, from the cold ones to the firarms. Thus she might use any weapon she finds in her way.

**Abilities**:
- *Fighting skills*:
Me has learned to fight to survive. She can fight with any kind of weapon and even with her bare hands.
- *Picklocking/Hacking skills*:
Me has been a thief during a period of her life. She learned picklocking skills and even some hacking skills to gain access to computer protected by passwords and some doors protected by electric systems.
- *Tech knowledge*:
Me has lived until the end of the Universe, thus she had the possibility to see the technological progress until its end.
- *Health regeneration*:
Me has been saved by the Doctor, who used the Mire technology on her, transforming her into an immortal being. Thanks to this technology, she has continous health regeneration. When she reaches 1 HP, she enters an inactivity phase, where she will regenerate to full health.

**Short Biography**:

Me is a Viking girl encountered by the Twelfth Doctor and Clara Oswald. After a battle against the Mire, she died, but the Doctor resurrected her using a Mire repair kit, transforming her into an immortal being. During her time, she asked several times to the Doctor to bring her with him as a companion during his travels in time and space, but the Doctor refused each time. For this reason, she became bitter to the Doctor and was convinced from the Time Lords to trick the Doctor into being transported inside his confession dial. Things went differently from what she has planned and Clara died. She didn't mean to kill Clara and apologized to the Doctor, who warned her it would be a good idea for her to stay out of his way.
Me survived until the end of the Universe, assisting to its death into a bubble of reality from Gallifrey, becoming the last living being on the Universe and waiting for the Doctor and Clara. When they arrived on Gallifrey, she saw them talking for their last time, when the Doctor wiped his memory of her. Then she decided to travel alongside Clara with her stolen Tardis.

	- Inhibit some plant properties.

**Abilities**:
- *Highlight scientific items*: 
Thanks to his laboratory and scientific knowledge, Max can easily detect scientific items, highlighting them. Besides, he can suggest paths inside the laboratory complex.
- *Identify weak spots*: 
Max's studies about the plants allow him to find weak spots on different kind of plants. Thanks to his plant knowledge he can provide useful advices.
- *Advanced scientist badge*: 
Laboratories' areas are hierachically divided. This badge allows Max to enter specific scientific areas in the laboratories (NOT each area of the laboratories).

**Short Biography**: 

Max is a member of the research team sent on the planet to determine wheater or not the planet could be a possible human colony. His studies are mainly focused on the planet vegetation, indeed he is a plant expert. When the earthquake happened, Max was caught by surprise by some plants and got trapped by some roots growing from the floor. Once saved by Clara and Me, Max initially decided to escape, but then was convinced by Me to fight alongside them to understand why the plants began attacking the humans and to save the human beings on the planet from an imminent catastrophe.

Yok is a brilliant scientist, a genius. His anatomy and biology studies allowed him to make several experiments on the humans in order to create a new form of being, an improvement of the human race, combining together the best traits from both the plants and the humans. The mutants created by Yok are not perfect, they presents several flaws, but his last untested composite is much more powerful than the precedent ones. Having no choices, Yok tested his last composite on himself, transforming himself into the perfect mutant. As a mutant, Yok can mutate the form of his arms, thanks to the plants' traits, and make some special attacks.

**Short Biography**:

Yok is the leader of the research team sent on the planet to study its structure and liveability. After some studies, he found a way to mix up traits from plants and humans in order to create a mutant. Over time, he developed his plan to create the *Perfect form*. He kept his plan and experiments secret to most of the scientists on the planet, but in the end Clara, Me and Max find it out and try to stop him. Having no choices, Yok transform himself into a mutant using his last untested composite, reaching the *Perfect form*.

**Short Biography**:

A long time ago a sentient plant seed started to attract solid matter to itself. The seed grew up, attracting more and more solid matter and transforming itself into a planetoid. After some time, the seed reached a form which allowed it to live as the planetoid core, letting itself grow as plants all over the surface. Once the humans landed on him, he decided to live in peace with them, because they also seemed to be peaceful and respectful towards him. When the humans started mistreating him he began to react passively and when Yok penetrated his core, The Primordial started to attack humans actively, manipulating the vegetation.

### 2.3.2. Enemies

These are the enemies the player must face during the game.

#### 2.3.2.1. Liannoyer

![Liannoyer](img/LDD_Liannoyer.jpg)

A Liannoyer is the most common plant creature, half the height of the PCs, that can be found in the laboratory complex after the earthquake. It senses humans through ground vibrations and attacks them by using his thorned liane as whips (*melee* attacks). They are weak to *slashing* damage. Max's serum (*Fytoprolipser*) is uneffective on these plants.

**Stats:**

- *Strength:* 14 (+2)
- *Dexterity:* 11 (+0)
- *Constitution:* 8 (-1)
- *Intelligence:* 2 (-4)
- *Wisdom:* 11 (+0)

#### 2.3.2.2. Needler

![Needler](img/LDD_Needler.jpg)

A Needler is a lethal plant creature, 3/4 the height of Me, it is often found in groups of other creatures. It sense humans through body temperature and attack on sight. Its attacks are *ranged* barrages of sharp needles. They are weak to *fire* and *slashing* damages. Max's serum (*Fytoprolipser*) is uneffective on these plants.

**Stats:**

- *Strength:* 8 (-1)
- *Dexterity:* 15 (+3)
- *Constitution:* 9 (-1)
- *Intelligence:* 5 (-3)
- *Wisdom:* 13 (+1)

#### 2.3.2.3. Treant

![Treant](img/LDD_Treant.jpg)

A Treant is a bulky, wooden plant creature, nearly the same height of the PCs. It is apparently innocue since it can be found as an unmoving obstacle in the level. It can be fought when enraged, it's attacks are *melee*: body slams and stomps that can *stun* the PCs. *Fire* and *bludgeoning* damages are useful against it. Max's serum (*Fytoprolipser*) is needed to let a Treant enrage and move from its position.

**Stats:**

- *Strength:* 17 (+3)
- *Dexterity:* 5 (-3)
- *Constitution:* 16 (+3)
- *Intelligence:* 3 (-4)
- *Wisdom:* 9 (-1)

#### 2.3.2.4. Elevine

![LDD_Liannoyer](img/LDD_Elevine.jpg)

An Elevine is a small plant creature similar to a vine mass that can be electrically charged, storing energy. Elevines usually crawl on the floor and are found in groups. They attack by swinging their electrical vines (*melee* attacks). Their frail body is weak to *slashing* damage but using *conductive* weapons can damage the user. Upon dying they discharge their bodies, causing a *ranged* electrical damage to each PC (*AoE*) that can *paralyze*. Max's serum (*Fytoprolipser*) is useful to inhibit their discharging ability and to keep them electrically charged after their defeat, Elevines defeated in this way can be used as electric source to power some devices.

**Stats:**

- *Strength:* 5 (-3)
- *Dexterity:* 16 (+3)
- *Constitution:* 7 (-2)
- *Intelligence:* 9 (-1)
- *Wisdom:* 14 (+2)

#### 2.3.2.5. Thunder Blossom 

![LDD_Liannoyer](img/LDD_ThunderBlossom.jpg)

The Thunder Blossom is a dangerous plant creature, nearly the same height of the PCs. These creatures are attracted by big power sources, from them they can accumulate big electrical charges in their bulb becoming more dangerous and powerful. They attack humans with fast, electrical charged lashes dealing heavy *melee* damage. When in danger they emit condensed pollen clouds that generate lightnings hitting randomly the surroundings, these clouds can be considered as enemies and are nullificated by dealing *frost* damage to them. Using *conductive* weapons can damage the user. Max's serum (*Fytoprolipser*) is useful to increase the resistivity of the creature, dealing damage each turn and weakening its damage output.

**Stats:**

- *Strength:* 17 (+3)
- *Dexterity:* 15 (+2)
- *Constitution:* 13 (+1)
- *Intelligence:* 9 (-1)
- *Wisdom:* 14 (+2)

**Electric Generator variation**: A Thunder Blossom is found in the second underground section of the laboratory, grasping the floor's generator, shutting off every technological system in the zone. This variation of the creature can be uselessly fought, it receives no damage because of his supercharged electrical body and deals slightly more damage to the PCs. The only way to defeat it is by overcharging the main electrical generator by activating all of the auxiliary ones found in other rooms, this will involve him exploding due to it's incapability to contain so much energy.

#### 2.3.2.6. Fire Flower

![LDD_Liannoyer](img/LDD_FireFlower.jpg)

A Fire Flower is an interesting and potentially deadly plant creature, half the height of the PCs. It can be found in the underground cave. Fire Flowers sense humans by ultrasounds and throw *scorching* embers to them (*ranged* attacks), causing a *damage over time* effect. When defeated by *slashing* damage, two brand new Fire Flowers will generate, this ability does not work if defeated by *bludgeoning* damage. Max's serum (*Fytoprolipser*) can be used to lower the temperature of the creature, making it weak to *frost* damage, if a Fire Flower is defeated by this type of damage it will not generate duplicates.

**Stats:**

- *Strength:* 5 (-3)
- *Dexterity:* 16 (+3)
- *Constitution:* 11 (0)
- *Intelligence:* 10 (0)
- *Wisdom:* 12 (+1)

#### 2.3.2.7. Spore Sprayer

![LDD_Liannoyer](img/LDD_SporeSprayer.jpg)

Spore Sprayers are plant creatures that cannot be fought due to their poisonous spores released in the area, killing every living being that breathes the spores. They can be defeated by preparing a chemical serum made with its own spores. Clara doesn't need to breathe, so she can freely move inside the contaminated area and defeat the plant.

#### 2.3.2.8. Overseers

![LDD_Liannoyer](img/LDD_Overseer.jpg)

The Overseers are non fighting plant creatures looking like roots out of the ground, found in the cave. The player must pay attention to their similarity with normal roots, when they are touched, they spawn many plant creatures to defend the cave. If the player manages to defeat each of the plant spawned by an Overseer he turns into normal roots.

## 2.4. Background

Once she was certain the Twelfth Doctor couldn't remember her, Clara got into the TARDIS and joined Me, then the TARDIS dematerialised leaving behind the Doctor and his own TARDIS.

Clara knows she must return to Gallifrey since her death was a fixed point in time, but she decides to take "the long way 'round" so that the two girls could "stop off along the way" and spend time adventuring together.

### 2.4.1. Human settlement backstory

A group of scientists found a planet with an Earth-like atmosphere and decided to settle a camp on it. They also built two laboratories, not too far from the camp, to conduct their studies on the plants. The scientists were studying the planet to understand if it could be a possible human colony. After conducting some research on the planet, the scientists discovered something interesting within the plants: they seemed to have the same DNA.

### 2.4.2. Exoplanet backstory

A long time ago a sentient plant seed started to attract solid matter to itself. The seed grew up, attracting more and more solid matter and transforming itself into a planetoid. After some time, the seed reached a form which allowed it to live as the planetoid core, letting itself grow as plants all over the surface.

## 2.5. Synopsis 

### 2.5.1. First act

**Level 1**
While traveling in spacetime and talking in broad terms about their latest adventure, Clara and Ashildr activate the TARDIS control panel and move towards their next destination.

As soon as they get ready and get out the TARDIS, the two girls realize they were in a human colony on an undefined planet. The diner-shaped TARDIS was ***out of style in spite of the surroundings*** (suggestion: *anachronistic*), though being hidden from the main ways nobody would ever notice it.

**Level 2**
The two girls take a look around, and explore the surroundings. From the looks of the sight and sounds, they were in a sort of landing area for small spaceships. The dead end on their way forces the duo to get inside a building, and as soon as they get outside from the other side they must stop at a guard post for identification. Clara and Ashildr show their psychic badges making up an excuse on the fly and telling them they are fresh crew, and are told that was not the area they were supposed to be since all scientific and technic personnel must stay in the campsite when not working.


Clara and Ashildr wonder what was the reason behind human presence on the planet; after brief investigation, and talking to some NPCs around, they discover the small colony was intended for scientific purposes and eventually colonization, and manage to make up a better cover from that moment on. Next, they needed to find a way to reach the main campsite, discovering there was an automatic railway at the other end of the spaceport. There were displays showing concepts of what seemed a rich and peaceful human city, a form of motivational advertising. Clara and Ashildr get to the railway, and leave for the campsite. **[plot point #1/threshold]**

**Level 3**
The campsite is made up of small modular buildings in which the lives of colonies goes on. By talking to people around (?), Clara and Ashildr learn colonists are mostly scientists and technicians, the rest is maintenance personnel in charge of keeping the colony up and running. They also get to learn there is a main scientific research project which focuses on studying local plants, the only form of life discovered on the planet. Since the girls' cover is being new personnel, they are redirected to the training facility in which they will be instructed about their tasks in the research labs.
 When they get there, the two of them learn about the main discovery of the scientific project: all plant life, despite being varying and different, has always something in common with the rest; it is to believe there is a common root to all plants on the planet, and they are close to a breakthrough.

### 2.5.2. Second act (1/2)

When asking for more info, Clara notices there's something worrying in the answer she's told from their trainer; the plant system has developed like a huge network, like a neural system and maybe even a form of intelligence; however there are rumors talking about voices and a danger, though few people really listen to these.

**Level 4**
Clara and Ashildr crave to know more about what starts to seem more like a mistery. They reach for the centralized archive in the research facility, where everything is stored, by finding a way to access such a reserved area. Reading result papers about studies and experiments, they learn about the unified plant network, possibly originated from a single big seed down below the planet surfaces, which possesses unique properties such as symbiotic adaptation with other plants and remarkable ability to adapt to nearly any environment condition.
**[Rising action, 1]** An emergency lockdown of all systems occurs shortly after the earth rumbles and a light tremble shakes the room, like an earthquake. A loud voice coming from the speakers tells the personnel to reach for the closest gathering area, and the two girls join the others outside of the building.

**Level 5**
After the emergency evacuation it was announced an incident in the underground laboratories, Clara and Ashildr volunteer to go with the rescue team claiming they can somehow help to move in the facility.
Clara and Ashildr get to the laboratories, and split from the rescue team in order to increase the chances to find the missing group of people. They face the security systems of the laboratories, and find a way to communicate to the other squad via a terminal. Once they are told the squad position, it's easy to find the way to them. Meanwhile, strange sounds are heard in the background, like something crawling underneath and around the corridors. Clara and Ashildr find the missing group of researchers, and they act nervous looking forward to get out as soon as possible. On the way back, Ashildr notices there has been a while since they heard from the other rescue team, and that was strange. Eventually they will be found dead or unconscious. Talking to some of the survivors, they pushed to get out quickly, allegedly blaming something gone wrong.
**[crisis]** While reaching for the exit, some plant-like minions appear from the ceiling. The group is confused by their presence, until one of them approaches one of the survivors and attacks. Clara and Ashildr must fight back these creatures, while keeping safe the others. Other encounters take place while reaching for the exit. Clara and Ashildr want to know the truth, and ask questions. The scientists expose their theory about the main seed shifting from a dormant state to active, and trying to defend itself from the humans. However the crew is reluctant to answer this kind of questions, except one which tells Clara they better talk somewhere else, far away from other people. Ashildr is not convinced by him/her, but Clara wants to take the shot. Either talking to the scientist or finding another way to gather more intel, Clara and Ashildr learn that more about the project and its real dangers can be found by talking to the project chief in person, who is missing too though in the other research facility. The duo decides to rescue him on their own.

### 2.5.3. Second act (2/2)

**Level 6**
**[rising action, 2/LEVEL START]** Next objective is to sneak in the second research facility and look for the scientist. He has been missing since the emergency, and nobody seems to know where he is. Clara wants to get to him or his work to make everything clear. The two of them are led by another scientist, who claims to be the professor's assistant, and is truly worried about what is going on in the colony. As well as before, Clara and Ashildr must face the base defense systems before getting to the research labs; everything looks more secured than before, and some areas look untidy as well. They are not able to find the professor, but notice a well-secured area beyond which a passage to a sort of cavern is located. They find a way through and notice some papers and documents, but no relevant information is found. Then they walk to the end of the cavern to find themselves in a great subterrain cave, at the center of which a giant bulb lies.
The stunning view of a giant plant seed from which many roots were coming out from, was accompained by the assistant explaining that was the very core of all the vegetation on the planet, and they were studying it due to its unique properties from a scientific point of view. The plant tries to obstacle the trio when they attempt to get closer, but then holds back and let them move to a certain distance from itself.
They establish a communication, the plant is sentient and talks to Clara and Ashildr; both asks why it is attacking the humans, but the answer is enigmatic: humans attacked first. After some talking, the two girls guessed the plant was just defending itself, but more details emerge when the plant tells them about the other scientist who is "creating monsters" and keeps all the proof in its hidden laboratory. **[revelation/LEVEL END]**

### 2.5.4. Third act

**Level 7**
Clara and Ashildr get back and manage to enter the secured laboratory they saw before; when inside, they find several documents on a research aimed to define the plant's rigenerative properties and a possible application for human beings. Further areas store diagrams showing a prototypal auto-rigenerative human arm, some vials with floating substances, and an archive of documents with the results of the research. Clara and Ashildr realize he was trying to make humans heal as fast as the plant by applying mutations to people, and this thought is confermed by what they find in the last rooms: tubes holding strange hybrid creatures, half-human and half-plant.
**[climax]** They find the professor here, who played lost and waiting for rescue; but then he understands pretending is not necessary anymore, and reveals its plan to Clara and Ashildr who were asking many questions. Then he runs away with some documents and vials, locks the door behind himself and frees the monsters inside the tubes.
Clara and Ashildr must fight for their lives. Once every enemy is defeated, they must find a way out of there and chase the professor before he gets away with his illicit experiments on the plant and on other personnel members.

**Level 8**
The two girls manage to get through the traps and obstacles activated by the professor fleeing. They find him and face him in a lasting fight; he uses its vials to summon his creatures, and ***finally augments himself*** in a desperate attempt to defeat Clara and Ashildr.
The two girls win the fight, and take the professor with them out of the facility, telling the others what really happened and his real intentions. He's brought away from the planet and ***everything is fixed*** to continue the life in the colony in peace once again.

## 3.1. Level information

Once outside the first laboratory, Clara and Ashildr meet some of the scientists they saved in the underground facilities. They are told something happened in the underground facilities of the second laboratory and they decide to go looking for some intel about what happened. Three scientists offer to accompany the girls inside the second laboratory, but suddenly the door opened and a couple of scientists run out of the lab screaming out of fear, making them change their minds. The scientists refused to go inside the lab, they wouldn't risk their lives again. Clara and Ashildr adventure by themselves inside the lab, which apparently seems desolate, to look for some info. ***(1)***
First rooms are empty, but then they find inside a room a scientist immobilized by a plant, which was going to kill him. Ashildr hit the plant, trying to save him, but it seems to be indestructible. ***(2)*** The scientist explains them they have to inject a serum into the plant first, to stop its regeneration process, and then they could kill it. Clara asks the scientist where to find the serum he just mentioned and the scientist replies they have to prepare it and inject it into the plant. He continues, telling them all they need is a big syringe, a herbicide and some sodium chloride. They have to find a herbicide and mix it with some sodium chloride to make it stronger and then to fill the big syringe with the chemical mix they made, the serum. Clara and Ashildr find the ingredients exploring the lab's rooms and prepare the serum. They inject the serum to the plant and then kill it, saving the scientist, who immediately thanks them. He presents himself as Max and explains them the plants had come to life and were rebelling against humans, trying to kill them. He continues saying that in the underground levels the scientists were conducting studies on the plants and assures them he told them everything he knew about what happened. ***(3)***
Clara tells there must be still people in trouble in the underground levels and that they had to find a way to save them. The scientist tells her she is crazy and that he wouldn’t have gone in the underground levels, first of all because all the people on those levels were probably dead by now, and then because he wouldn’t have risked his life for them. The scientist suggests everyone to escape.
Ashildr says she wouldn’t have escaped like a coward, irritating the scientist, who answers her he is not a coward, he is just a normal person, not a crazy one like her. After that, he tries to exit the door but plant creatures appear outside, trying to kill him.
Ashildr saves him from the plants and closes the door, barricading it with the nearest cabinet.
The scientist agrees to join their “team” and to go to the underground levels, but now they were stuck in that room, with plant creatures outside it.
After a moment of hesitation, Clara starts talking and explains her plan: they could use the ventilation ducts and find a way to the elevator. Everyone agree to Clara's plan and they start going in the ventilation ducts until they arrive in a empty room, which the scientist recognizes. The scientist knows where the elevator is and tells them it’s not too far from their position. He offers to guide them and starts moving. ***(4)***
Once they reach the elevator, they call it, but when it arrives, the door does not open and they find out it’s blocked. Someone tries to fix it up, but in the meanwhile a group of plant creatures arrives and threatens them. Clara and Ashildr have to find a way to give the one fixing the door some time to fix it. They have to slow the plant creatures down. ***(5)***
They had to save as many scientists as possible and to find out the truth behind these creatures. ***(6)*** After surviving an ambush from many plant creatures ***(7)*** they reach a great gate leading to an underground cave strangely full of vegetation with the upper side covered by some shiny crystals, their attention was taken by a blinding light flowing outside a hole in the ground. They find out a rough tunnel leading to another cave, unnaturally shiny, where they find out a giant seed emanating a strange warm light. ***(8)***
The scientist stated, by checking on his tablet, that they were in the center of the planet. A loud noise of roots moving is heard and a shape resembling some kind of face form from a near stone. The face ask them: “Again here… What are you willing to do to me this time?! GO AWAY!”. After an useless battle against the plants, the party is captured by roots and vines, begging for their lives, the scientist say this had to be caused by that mad professor. ***(9)***
They felt the plants hesitate. The plant face say that a man like him did all this, uncovering the final truth. The real enemy is that professor, the seed was the main test subject! ***(10)***

# 4. Level puzzles

In this section are described the puzzles included in the 6th level, *Disclosure*.

## 4.1 Save Max

**Problem**
After the earthquake, the plants awakened and start attacking the humans. Max has been caught off guard by some plants and got trapped inside a laboratory's room.

**Solution**
The player has to save Max from the plants trapping him:

1. Find the Herbicide.
2. Find the Sodium Chloride.
3. Find the Empty Sprayer.
4. Mix the Herbicide together with the Sodium Chloride and put it into the Empty Sprayer.
5. Use the resulting compound against the plants trapping Max.

## 4.2 Overcharge the generators

**Problem**
A giant electric plant is wrapping around the floor main electric generator, absorbing all the energy and letting the floor in the dark. 
The player can approach the plant and fight, but it won't get hurt, and the player eventually gets damaged.

**Solution**
The only way to beat it is overloading the plant by turning on the supplementary independent generators located in the other rooms, so that the plant can't deal with this amount of energy and blowing up. Then, the only thing to do is turning the generator on once again:

1. Find and turn on all smaller generators (*gen*) [yellow arrows].
2. All smaller generators overload the main generator (*GEN*), the plant cannot absorb this amount of energy and blows up 3 seconds after the player gets back to the main generator room [red arrow].
3. A black-out follows, turn on the main generator [blue arrow] and continue the game by opening previous locked electric doors.

## 4.3 Unlock the door

**Problem**
The door leading to the Cave is blocked by some roots, which cannot be destroyed using weapons.

**Solution**
The player has to find a way to unlock the door to reach the Cave:

1. Try to open the door, but it won't open, because it's blocked.
2. Find the hydraulic system.
3. Overcharge the hydraulic system using the valves. The water pressure increases, allowing the door to receive much more energy.
4. Open the door. The water pressure is so high that the door will quickly open, destroying the roots blocking it.
