While roaming in the spacetime, Clara and Ashildr

- must deal with the TARDIS not properly working.

or

- decide to let the fate choose their next destination.

The two eventually land on a misterious planet, in the middle of a plain valley. As soon as they get out of the TARDIS, they notice how particular the local vegetation is, staring at the view of plants and their colorful shapes.

The two girls start exploring the surroundings, looking for some adventure. Along their path is the wild nature, with its colors and flowers and strange plants and trees. They suddendly look unnatural to Ashildr, and Clara agrees. Their walk is led by what seems to be an old path on the ground, which leads to some abandoned structures. Here occurs their first meeting with some of the locals, which ambush them. The fight ends soon, because the locals stop attacking the two girls as Clara tries to reassure them they weren't hostile.

Locals are nervous, but act friendly. After some chit-chat, the pack leader tells the two girls why they attacked them: they mistook the two girls for sort of other creatures. Clara wants to know more, but everyone is quite reluctant to answer.

When Clara asks where the rest of the population lives, she is told she is standing right in front of a city, although she couldn't see it. Clara and Ashildr are told population began living inside mountains, because it was the only places "they" couldn't reach.

Ashildr asks who "they" are, and the two girls become aware of the creatures ravaging the whole planet: plant-like alien monsters that extend and absorb anything in their path, to grow as much as they can until the whole surface is covered by them. They came from space, and the population was unprepared to fight them back properly. A war began, and the aliens were winning it, until the day locals found a way to keep this plague away from their cities and outposts: building them inside caves and rocky places, since roots weren't able to dig such a hard material. This was the only solution, unless a weapon to fight back was found.

After being escorted inside the city, Clara and Ashildr decide to help the locals fighting back the alien plant. First, they need to gather more intel about the alien threat, afterwards a plan can be devised. Crossing another wood area, some enemies are fought and a vegetation specimen is acquired and brought into the TARDIS for analysis.

The new information reveals there are no multiple plants, though one single organism capable of deploy smaller independents parts that can be eventually reabsorbed. Its nature is plant-like and behave accordingly, although moving as fast as any human or animal, and capable of absorbing nearby objects to build up a harder structure and so fight other creatures (e.g. rock golems, earth minions, ...). Also, the bulb produces toxins that make the sky cloudy, hence the plant is somehow sensitive to strong light sources, maybe UV rays can be mortal to it.

Sharing such information with the people, it's time to plan the strike back.

The aim of our heroins is to get rid of the vegetation purging all the surface; to do so, they must seek and defeat the surface bulbs of the plant, which are responsible of secreting the toxins in the atmosphere. Being the alien entity sort of sentient, it will try to defend itself in any way, so they all must be ready to fight if needed.

Once the skies are clear, it's time to defeat the core. It is located in the middle of a crater, surrounded by a thick forest in order to be hidden.

Eventually Clara and Ashildr, together with some other local companions, accomplish their mission by defeating the guardians of each toxic bulb and destroying the core bulb of the plant, which represents the alien itself.

Once the planet is safe, the two girls are accaimed by the local people and told to keep staying with them. After taking part to the celebrations, they bid farewell everybody especially their adventure companions, then leave again towards the unknown.
