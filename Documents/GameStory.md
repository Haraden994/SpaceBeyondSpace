##High Concept
Landed in a small green planet, Clara and Ashildr discover a scientific colony studying the local vegetation. An ancient mystery lies beneath the ground. Adventure yourself in the depths of the research facilities to unveil what threatens the people inside. With Clara’s brilliance and Ashildr’s experience the path seems simple, but people aren’t the only ones to be rescued.


##Backstory

###Scientists' backstory
A group of scientists found a weird planet with an Earth-like atmosphere and decided to settle a camp on it. They also built two laboratories, not too far from the camp, to conduct their studies on the plants.
The scientists were studying the planet to understand if it could be a possible human colony.
After conducting some research on the planet, the scientists discovered something interesting within the plants: they seemed to have the same DNA.

###Planet's backstory
A long time ago a sentient plant seed started to attract solid particles to itself. The seed grew up, attracting more and more solid particles and transforming itself into a planetoid.
After some time, the seed reached a form who allowed it to live as the planetoid core, letting itself grow as plants all over the surface.


##Synopsis

##Theme

##Setting
The story is set in a planet whose core is a sentient seed. The planet surface is mostly composed by vegetation and the atmosphere is similar to the Earth’s one.
On the planet’s surface, the scientists built a camp and two laboratories (one opposite to the other) forming a T (where the camp is on the base of the T, and the two laboratories on the other two extremities). The two laboratories are not too far one another and they both have the same distance (longer than the one from the two laboratories) from the main camp. Both the laboratories are built on more levels, including underground levels.
Near the camp there is a landing zone for spaceships.
